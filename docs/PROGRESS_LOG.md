## 2026-09-24 — F0 (reconstructed)

- Layer ID: F0 (repository setup and mapping).
- Developer/agent: F0 implementation agent (prior session). Reconstructed
  2026-09-24 during F0.1 from F0 docs and the supplied F0 report — commands
  below are **reported**, not re-run by the F0.1 agent.
- Objective: clone five repos, verify origins/branches, record tooling/ports,
  create shared context + handoffs + prompts + READMEs. No implementation.
- Changes: cloned `auditor-backend` from
  `https://github.com/NEXYRA-Techy-Panda/auditor-backend.git` into
  `../auditor-backend` (`main`, no commits). Created untracked `README.md`,
  `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `docs/WORKSPACE_MAP.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_START_PROMPT.md`. Same pattern in siblings.
- Decisions/reasons: five independent repos; npm for JS/TS; proposed ports
  (this repo 4001; Python service 8000); Node `>=20.9` / Python `3.12`
  provisional until F2.
- Commands/checks (as reported): clone/verify/fetch/ls-remote (empty),
  version checks (Node v24.21.0, npm 11.19.0, Git 2.55.0.windows.5; Python
  unavailable), netstat (ports free). Parent not a Git repo.
- Unresolved at F0 close: Python missing; Node pin undecided; docs uncommitted;
  F1 pending.
- Next action (as closed): return F0 evidence; await review.
- Review status and evidence source: **Accepted by architecture lead based on
  supplied evidence; local files were not directly inspected by the lead.**
- Commit references: none.

## 2026-09-24 17:47:57 +05:30 (IST) — F0.1 (actual)

- Layer ID: F0.1 (durable agent continuity, docs only).
- Developer/agent: F0.1 implementation agent (this session).
- Objective: continuity files + onboarding protocol.
- Changes (this repo): created `docs/ACTIVE_TASK.md`; this `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md`;
  pending: `HANDOFF.md`, `AGENT_START_PROMPT.md`, `README.md` updates + final
  ACTIVE_TASK update.
- Decisions/reasons: verify-then-edit; preserve F0 docs; per-repo identity
  (owner Mohan; auditor Node work independent of Python until F4 integration).
- Commands/checks and actual results: AGENTS.md absent; `main`; correct origin;
  `status --short` → `?? README.md`, `?? docs/`; `log` → no commits; file
  listing matches F0 report.
- Unresolved items: remaining F0.1 edits; review pending; no commits (by design).
- Next action: update HANDOFF/START_PROMPT/README; mark ACTIVE_TASK completed;
  readiness check; return F0.1 evidence. Do not begin F1.
- Review status and evidence source: pending; this file set + F0.1 report
  (working tree inspected directly).
- Commit references: none.

## 2026-09-24 17:51:10 +05:30 (IST) — F0.1 completion checkpoint (actual)

- Layer ID: F0.1. Task status: completed. Review status: pending (never
  self-assigned).
- Changes since the 17:47 entry: HANDOFF.md §0 set to completed; README links
  added; ACTIVE_TASK.md marked completed with full record; verification suite
  run (branch/origin/status/log per repo, 35-path link check, no-artifact scan,
  secret scan — all clean).
- Uncommitted changes: all F0 + F0.1 docs remain untracked by design; no commits.
- Next action: Return F0.1 evidence for architecture review; do not begin F1
  until its prompt is supplied.
- Commit references: none.

## 2026-09-24 18:02:31 +05:30 (IST) — F1 started (actual)

- Layer ID: F1 (versioned shared data + interface contract, design only).
- Developer/agent: F1 implementation agent (this session).
- Objective: define contract v1.0.0 (canonical in simulation-backend,
  mirrored to siblings) with fixtures + dependency-free verification; no
  application code.
- F0.1 outcome preserved above (completed; review pending at F0.1 close).
  F0/F0.1 review: accepted by architecture lead based on supplied evidence;
  local files were not directly inspected by the lead.
- Startup state: no AGENTS.md; all repos on `main`, correct origins, no
  commits, only untracked F0/F0.1 docs; fetch OK. Matches report.
- Owner updates applied/planned: Python 3.13.15 verified at supplied
  interpreter path (PATH shim stale, not modified); F0.1 "read-only" wording
  to be corrected; commit+push authorised from F1; hosting plan recorded
  (frontends Vercel, backends+Python on Mohan's VPS; no deployment in F1).
- Blockers/unknowns: no git user.name/user.email configured and no `gh` —
  commit/push will be attempted at completion; if auth fails, hashes and the
  exact remediation will be reported, nothing invented.
- Next action: author canonical contract bundle in
  `simulation-backend/contracts/v1/` + `scripts/verify-contract.mjs`.
- Review status: pending. Commit references: none yet.

## 2026-09-24 18:40:00 +05:30 (IST) — F1 contract authored + verified (actual)

- Changes: contract mirror received under `contracts/v1/` (+
  `scripts/verify-contract.mjs`, `.gitignore`); canonical copy lives in
  `simulation-backend/contracts/v1/`.
- Verification: `node scripts/verify-contract.mjs` → 49 passed, 0 failed in
  all five repos. Semantic checks only; formal schema validation is F2.
- Next action: continuity doc updates, then commit + push per repo.
- Review status: pending. Commit references: none yet.

---

## 2026-09-24 18:29:39 +05:30 (IST) — F1 commit/push blocked (actual)

- Contract work complete and verified (49/49 in all five repos); mirror +
  continuity docs + evidence files done.
- Commit blocked: no git user.name/user.email (commit in simulation-backend
  failed with exit 128, "Author identity unknown"). Asked Mohan twice; no
  values supplied, nothing configured, nothing invented. No commits exist;
  no push attempted (push auth untested). This repo remains fully untracked.
- To unblock: configure identity, then per repo `git add`, `git commit -m
  "docs: establish foundation and v1 data contracts"`, `git push -u origin
  main`, verifying each remote hash. No force-push.
- Task status set to blocked (commit/push step only); review pending.

## 2026-09-24 18:37:52 +05:30 (IST) — F1-R1 started (actual)

- Layer ID: F1-R1 (targeted pre-acceptance corrections, mirror repo). F1
  implementation completed; architecture review: changes_requested.
- Prior publishing resolved: F1 committed + pushed in all five repos.
- Objective: receive corrected mirrors (self-contained CSV; 12 dp precision +
  tolerances; extended verifier). Version stays 1.0.0. No F2.
- Startup: no AGENTS.md; clean tree at F1 commit; repo-local identity set.
- Next action: corrections authored in `simulation-backend`, then mirrored here.
- Review status: pending. Commit references: F1 pushed (see ACTIVE_TASK).

---

## 2026-09-24 18:43:07 +05:30 (IST) — F1-R1 completed (actual)

- Corrected mirror received and verified 54/54 (all five repos).
- Continuity updated: ACTIVE_TASK completed, HANDOFF F1-R1 addendum,
  F1_EVIDENCE F1-R1 section. Review pending; no approval claimed.
- Next action: commit, push `main`, verify remote hash; return F1-R1 evidence.
  Do not begin F2.
- Commit references: F1 pushed; F1-R1 recorded after push.
